title: Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PCF v2.5
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic serves as a checklist for preparing to upgrade Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) from v2.4 to v2.5.

This topic contains important preparation steps that you must follow before beginning your upgrade. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause the upgrade to fail.

After completing the steps in this topic, you can continue to [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

<p class="note warning"><b>Warning:</b> Pivotal does not recommend that you skip minor versions when upgrading PCF. Skipping minor versions when upgrading PCF may result in breaking changes. To avoid additional breaking changes, upgrade PCF to the minor version that directly follows your current version of PCF.</p>


## <a id="back-up-your-pcf-deployment"></a> Back Up Your PCF Deployment

Pivotal recommends backing up your PCF deployment before upgrading, to restore in the case of failure. To do this, follow the instructions in the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](../customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html) topic.


## <a id='decryption-passphrase'></a> Find Your Decryption Passphrase for Ops Manager

To complete the Ops Manager upgrade, you must have your Ops Manager decryption passphrase. You defined this decryption passphrase during the initial installation of Ops Manager.

## <a id='cflinuxfs3'></a> Migrate Apps to cflinuxfs3

In PAS v2.5, `cflinuxfs2` is no longer supported. Before upgrading to PAS v2.5, developers must change their stack to `cflinuxfs3` and restage their apps.

To prepare for your upgrade, do the following:

1. Install the Stack Auditor plugin for the cf CLI. See [Install Stack Auditor](../adminguide/stack-auditor.html#install) in _Using the Stack Auditor Plugin_.

1. Audit stack usage to determine which apps need to be migrated from `cflinuxfs2` to `cflinuxfs3`. You can list apps and their stacks for each org you have access to by running the following command. To see all the apps in your deployment, ensure that you are logged in to the cf CLI as a user who can access all orgs. 

    ```
    cf audit-stack
    ```

    See the following example output:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf audit-stack
    first-org/development/first-app cflinuxfs2 
    first-org/staging/first-app cflinuxfs2
    first-org/production/first-app cflinuxfs2
    second-org/development/second-app cflinuxfs3
    second-org/staging/second-app cflinuxfs3
    second-org/production/second-app cflinuxfs3
    ...
    </pre>

1. Communicate to developers that they must migrate their existing apps to `cflinuxfs3` and begin pushing all new apps on `cflinuxfs3`. When changing stacks, developers may see errors related to new or changed libraries. If they do, they must update their app accordingly. Developers can migrate their apps using two methods:
  * `cf push`: See [Restaging Apps on a New Stack](../devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html#cli-commands) in _Changing Stacks_.
  * `cf change-stack`: See [Change Stacks](../adminguide/stack-auditor.html#change-stacks) in _Using the Stack Auditor Plugin_. This method does not require the source code of the app.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When changing the stack, the app experiences downtime. Pivotal recommends changing the stack using a zero-downtime strategy or at a time when you feel downtime is acceptable. To avoid the brief downtime, use a blue-green strategy. See <a href="../devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html">Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk</a>.</p>

1. Confirm that there are no apps running on `cflinuxfs2 ` using the `cf audit-stack` command.

1. Delete all buildpacks in your deployment that are associated with `cflinuxfs2`. 


1. Delete the `cflinuxfs2` stack. This action cannot be undone, with the following exception: If you delete <code>cflinuxfs2</code> and update to a later patch release of PAS v2.4, the stack returns and you must delete it again before upgrading to PAS v2.5.</p>
  1. Run the following command:

        ```
        cf delete-stack cflinuxfs2
        ```
  1. When prompted, type `cflinuxfs2` and press enter. 

    See the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-stack cflinuxfs2
    Are you sure you want to remove the cflinuxfs2 stack? If so, type the name of the stack [cflinuxfs2]
    >cflinuxfs2
    Deleting stack cflinuxfs2...
    Stack cflinuxfs2 has been deleted. 
    </pre>

    If you have any apps still running on `cflinuxfs2`, the command returns the following error:

    <pre class="terminal">
    Failed to delete stack cflinuxfs2 with error: Please delete the app associations for your stack.   
    </pre>

## <a id="tiles-addons"></a> Update Tiles and Add-Ons

The following section describes changes you must make to your product tiles and add-ons before upgrading PCF.

### <a id="compatibility"></a> Review Tile Compatibility

Before you upgrade to PCF v2.5, check whether the service tiles that you currently have deployed on PCF v2.4 are compatible with PCF v2.5.

To check PCF versions supported by a service tile, either from Pivotal or a Pivotal partner:

* Navigate to the tile's download page on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
* Select the tile version in the **Releases** dropdown.
* See the **Depends On** section under **Release Details**. For more information, refer to the tile's release notes.

If the currently-deployed version of a tile is not compatible with PCF v2.5, you must upgrade the tile to a compatible version before you upgrade PCF. You do not need to upgrade tiles that are compatible with both PCF v2.4 and v2.5.

Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.5. Pivotal works with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of PCF. For more information about which partner service release compatibility, review the **Depends On** section of the partners tile download page, the partners services release documentation in [Pivotal Documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the service tile.

The [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) provides an overview of which PCF versions support which versions of the most popular service tiles from Pivotal.

#### <a id="env"></a> Environment Details

Pivotal provides the empty table below as a model to print out or adapt for recording and tracking the tile versions that you have deployed in all of your environments.

### <a id="upgrade-service-tiles"></a> Upgrade Services Tiles

Upgrade all service tiles to versions that are compatible with PCF v2.5. Service tiles are add-on products you install alongside your runtime. For example, MySQL for PCF, PCF Healthwatch, and RabbitMQ are service tiles.

Do not upgrade runtime tiles, such as PAS, PASW, or Pivotal Container Service (PKS), at this time.

Review the [Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) and tile documentation to check version compatibility.

### <a id='bosh-cli'></a> Install BOSH CLI v5.4.0 or Later

Install [BOSH CLI v5.4.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli/releases/tag/v5.4.0) to avoid IP conflict errors that cause BOSH healthcheck tasks to fail to acquire locks. For more information, see [BOSH health check tasks fails to acquire lock](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/bosh-health-check-tasks-fails-to-acquire-lock) in the Pivotal Knowledge Database.

### <a id='bosh-director'></a> Configure BOSH Director

With each release of a new PCF version, BOSH Director may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. See the following for what action to take before upgrading to PCF v2.5:

#### <a id="check-specs"></a> Check Required Machine Specifications

Check the required machine specifications for Ops Manager v2.5. These specifications are specific to your IaaS. If these specifications do not match your existing Ops Manager, modify the values of your Ops Manager VM instance. For example, if the boot disk of your existing Ops Manager is 50&nbsp;GB and the new Ops Manager requires 100&nbsp;GB, then increase the size of your Ops Manager boot disk to 100&nbsp;GB.

#### <a id="ssl-apps-manager"></a> Ensure CA is Trusted by BOSH Director

Starting in PAS v2.4.3, Apps Manager verifies SSL certificates for endpoints to which it proxies. For environments using self-signed certificates or certificates that are signed by a certificate authority that is not trusted by the BOSH Director, this may cause Apps Manager to show no content.

If you are upgrading to PAS v2.5 from PAS v2.4.2 or earlier, you can prevent this issue by adding the certificate authority using the **Trusted Certificates** field in the **Security** pane of the BOSH Director tile.

### <a id='patch'></a> Configure PAS

With each release of a new PCF version, PAS may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. See the following sections for what action to take before upgrading to PCF v2.5:

#### <a id="deselect-override"></a> Deselect Option to Override Deployment Name to CF

Ensure that the **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** option in the **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS tile is deselected. This is a requirement to upgrade successfully.

Additionally, if you have PCF Healthwatch installed and you changed the value of **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** in PAS, you must run the **Push Monitoring Components** errand for Healthwatch to detect the change.

For more information, see [Removed Option to Override Deployment Name to CF](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#deployment-name).

#### <a id="groot-gc"></a> Configure Diego Cell Garbage collection

In the PAS tile **Application Container** pane, if **Docker Images Disk-Cleanup Scheduling on Cell VMs** is set to **Clean up disk-space once threshold is reached** and the value of **Threshold of Disk-Used (MB)** below has been changed from the default of `10240`, then operators need to pick a new threshold. If the scheduling is set to **Never clean up...** or **Routinely clean up...***, or the threshold value is set to the default, then no action is necessary and any threshold migrates to a sensible value. For more information see [Options for Disk Cleanup](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsguide/config-cell-cleanup.html).

#### <a id="route-integrity"></a> Configure Gorouter with TLS

Before upgrading to PAS v2.5, you must secure the Gorouter with TLS or mutual TLS for PAS and Isolation Segment tiles.

The following sections describe how to enable routing with TLS or mutual TLS and scale the Diego cell VM CPU and RAM. If you do not have enough RAM on your Diego cell VM after enabling TLS routing, you are unable to stage tasks and app instances. App instances may also stop running.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Gorouter with TLS or mutual TLS is not supported in the PASW tile.</p>

<strong><a id="enable-tls"></a> Step 1: Enable TLS or Mutual TLS Routing</strong>

To enable TLS or mutual TLS routing, do the following:

1. From the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**, go to the PAS tile.

1. Go to the **Application Containers** pane.

1. Under **Router application identity verification**, select either of the following options:
  - **Router uses TLS to verify application identity**
  - **Router and applications use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**

1. Click **Save**.

<strong><a id="ram-size"></a> Step 2: Determine Number of App Instances</strong>

Before you scale your Diego cell VM to handle TLS routing, you must determine the number of app instances running on your deployment.

See the following methods for how you can count your app instances. Choose the method that corresponds to your use case.

* **Deployments without Isolation Segments**
  	1. Access your platform metrics with your configured monitoring tool or with cf CLI
  	Firehose nozzle plugin. For more information about the CLI Firehose nozzle plugin, see
  	[Installing the Loggregator Firehose Plugin for cf CLI](../loggregator/cli-plugin.html).
  	For more information about configuring a monitoring system, see [Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System](../monitoring/metrics.html).
  	1. Find the `LRPsDesired` metric of the `bbs` job on the Diego Database VM. See the following example:
		<pre class="terminal">origin:"bbs" eventType:ValueMetric
		timestamp:1541543212057232344 deployment:"cf" job:"diego\_database"
		index:"b1f0c6d8-274b-4cfc-bfa1-a6feeb351802" ip:"10.0.4.10"
		tags:&lt; key:"instance\_id" value:"b1f0c6d8-274b-4cfc-bfa1-a6feeb351802" >
		tags:&lt; key:"source\_id" value:"bbs" > valueMetric:&lt; name:"LRPsDesired"
		<span style="color: #5FABFF">value:200</span> unit:"Metric" ></pre>
	1. Record the `value` of the `LRPsDesired` for each instance of the `bbs`
	job. You need the `value` for the procedure in the next section.

* **Deployments with Isolation Segments**
  	1. Access your platform metrics with your configured monitoring tool or with cf CLI
  	Firehose nozzle plugin. For more information about the CLI Firehose nozzle plugin, see
  	[Installing the Loggregator Firehose Plugin for cf CLI](../loggregator/cli-plugin.html).
  	For more information about configuring a monitoring system, see [Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System](../monitoring/metrics.html).
  	1. Find all `ContainerCount` metrics of the `rep` job of each Diego cell VM. See the following example:
   		<pre class="terminal">origin:"rep" eventType:ValueMetric
		timestamp:1541543910092859448 deployment:"cf" job:"diego\_cell"
		index:"8007afda-3bff-4856-857f-a47a43cbf994" <span style="color:#5FABFF">ip:"10.0.4.18"</span>
		tags:&lt; key:"instance_id" value:"8007afda-3bff-4856-857f-a47a43cbf994" >
		tags:&lt; key:"source\_id" value:"rep" > valueMetric:&lt; name:
		"ContainerCount" <span style="color: #5FABFF">value:200</span> unit:"Metric" ></pre>
	1. For each `ContainerCount` metric, record the `value` of the `ContainerCount`
	and the `ip` of the `job`.

<strong><a id="scale-diego-cell"></a> Step 3: Scale Diego Cell VM</strong>

To support TLS or mutual TLS routing, you must have enough CPU and RAM for your Diego cell VM. TLS routing requires an additional 32&nbsp;MB of RAM on your Diego cell per app instance.

To calculate and configure the amount of RAM you need for your Diego cell, choose one of the following methods for your use case:

* **Deployments without Isolation Segments**
<p>For your PAS tile, do the following:</p>
   1. Go to the **Resource Config** pane.
   1. In the **Diego Cell** row, see your current **VM Type** with the amount of RAM you currently have.
   1. Multiply the `value` you recorded in the previous section by 32. Add your solution
   to the amount of RAM you currently have.
   1. Select your new **VM Type** based on the amount of RAM you need.
   1. Click **Save**.
* **Deployments with Isolation Segments**
<p>For each PAS and Isolation Segment tile in your foundation, do the following:</p>
   1. Go to the **Status** tab and see the IP of your Diego cell. To determine the `value`
   that corresponds to this tile, match the IP to the `ip`
   metric you recorded in the previous section.
   1. Go to the **Resource Config** pane of the the tile.
   1. In the **Diego Cell** row, see your current **VM Type** with the amount of RAM you currently have.
   1. Multiply the `value` for this tile by 32. Add your solution
   to the amount of RAM you currently have.
   1. Select your new **VM Type** based on the amount of RAM you need.
   1. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="metric-registrar"></a> (Optional) Migrate from Metrics Forwarder to Metric Registrar

The Metric Registrar allows app developers to export custom app metrics to Loggregator. Metrics Forwarder for PCF is a service that also allows apps to emit custom metrics.  

Metrics Forwarder for PCF is not supported in PAS v2.5. If you use Metrics Forwarder for PCF to emit custom app metrics to Loggregator, Pivotal recommends enabling and configuring the Metric Registrar before upgrading to PAS v2.5. The PAS tile does not deploy the Metric Registrar by default. 

To enable the Metric Registrar, do the following:

1. In the PAS tile, click **Metric Registrar**.

1. Select the **Enable Metric Registrar** checkbox.

For more information about enabling the Metric Registrar in PAS, see [(Optional) Configure Metric Registrar](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/configure-pas.html#metric-registrar) in _Configuring PAS_.

For more information about the Metric Registrar, see [Registering Custom App Metrics](../metric-registrar/using.html).

#### <a id="disable-unused-errands"></a> (Optional) Disable Unused Errands

To save upgrade time, you can disable unused PAS post-deploy errands. See the [Post-Deploy Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/tile-errands.html#post-deploy) section of the Errands topic for details.
Only disable these errands if your environment does not need them.

In some cases, if you have previously disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, you may want to re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see the [Adding and Deleting Products](../customizing/add-delete.html#add-import) topic.

### <a id="stemcell-compat"></a> Check OS Compatibility of BOSH-Managed Add-Ons and Tiles

Before upgrading to PCF v2.5, operators who have deployed any PCF add-ons such as **IPsec for PCF**, **ClamAV for PCF**, or **File Integrity Monitoring for PCF** and who have deployed or are planning to deploy PASW must modify the add-on manifest to specify a compatible OS stemcell. For more information, see [Pivotal Application Service for Windows](../windows/index.html).

For example, **File Integrity Monitor for PCF** (FIM) is not supported on Windows. Therefore, the manifest must use an `include` directive to specify the target OS stemcell of `ubuntu-trusty` and `ubuntu-xenial`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To upgrade to a Xenial stemcell, see the documentation for each add-on and follow the instructions.</p>

To update an add-on manifest, do the following:

1. Locate your existing add-on manifest file. For example, for FIM, locate the `fim.yml` you uploaded to the Ops Manager VM.

1. Modify the manifest to include following `include` directive to your manifest:

    ```yml
      include:
        stemcell:
          - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```

1. Upload the modified manifest file to your PCF deployment. For example instructions, see [Create the FIM Manifest](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/index.html#create-mfest).

If you use any other BOSH-managed add-ons in your deployment, you should verify OS compatibility for those component as well. For more information about configuring BOSH add-on manifests, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html#addons).

### <a id="azure-blobstore-addon"></a> Check Backup and Restore External Blobstore Add-On

If you have enabled external blobstore backups for an Azure Blobstore using the [Blobstore Add-On](../../customizing/backup-restore/enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html#azure), you must update your runtime configuration to remove the `sdk-preview` add-on before upgrading to PCF v2.5. If you do not remove this job, upgrading PAS fails with the error:

<pre>
Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:01)
  L Error: Colocated job 'azure-blobstore-backup-restorer' is already added to the instance group 'backup-restore'.
</pre>

After removing this job from your runtime configuration, ensure that the **Enable backup and restore** checkbox is enabled in the PAS tile > **File Storage** pane.

## <a id="cert-expiry"></a> Check Certificate Authority Expiration Dates

Depending on the requirements of your deployment, you may need to rotate your Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. The non-configurable certificates in your deployment expire every two years. You must regenerate and rotate them so that critical components do not face a complete outage.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PCF uses SHA-2 certificates and hashes by default. You can convert existing SHA-1 hashes into SHA-2 hashes by rotating your Ops Manager certificates using the procedure described in the <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-saml-ca">Regenerating and Rotating Non-Configurable TLS/SSL Certificates</a> section of <em>Managing TLS Certificates</em>.</p>

To retrieve information about all the RSA and CA certificates for the BOSH Director and other products in your deployment, you can use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` request of the Ops Manager API.

In this request, the `expires_within` parameter is optional. Valid values for the parameter are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, to search for certificates expiring within one month, replace `TIME` with `1m`:

<pre class="terminal">$ curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=1m" \
 -X GET \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
</pre>

For information about regenerating and rotating CA certificates, see [Managing TLS Certificates](../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).


## <a id="capacity"></a> Check the Capacity of Your Deployment

The following sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment has adequate capacity to perform the upgrade.

### <a id="confirm-om-disk"></a> Confirm Adequate Disk Space

<%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

### <a id="check-diego-cell-ram-and-disk"></a> Check Diego Cell RAM and Disk

Check that Diego cells have sufficient available RAM and disk capacity to support app containers.

The KPIs that monitor these these resources are are:

* `rep.CapacityRemainingMemory`
* `rep.CapacityRemainingDisk`

### <a id="adjust-diego-cell-limits"></a> Adjust Diego Cell Limits

If needed, adjust the maximum number of Diego cells that the platform can upgrade simultaneously, to avoid overloading the other cells. See [Limit PCF Component Instances During Restart](./configuring.html#limit-restart).

For PCF v1.10 and later, the maximum number of cells that can update at once, `max_in_flight` is 4%. This setting is configured in the BOSH manifest's Diego cell definition. For more information, see the [Prevent Overload](./configuring.html#limitations-considerations) section.

Review the [Diego Cell Metrics](../monitoring/kpi.html#cell) section of the KPI topic for more information about these KPIs.

### <a id="storage"></a> Review File Storage IOPS and Other Upgrade Limiting Factors

During the PCF upgrade process, a large quantity of data is moved around on disk.

To ensure a successful upgrade of PCF, verify that your underlying PAS file storage is performant enough to handle the upgrade. For more information about the configurations to evaluate, see [Upgrade Considerations for Selecting Pivotal Cloud Foundry Storage](../upgrading/configuring.html#file-storage).

In addition to file storage IOPS, consider additional existing deployment factors that can impact overall upgrade duration and performance:

|**Factor**|**Impact**|
|----------|----------|
|**Network latency**| Network latency can contribute to how long it takes to move app instance data to new containers. |
|**Number of ASGs**| A large number of [Application Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html) in your deployment can contribute to an increase in app instance container startup time. |
|**Number of app instances and application growth**| A large increase in the number of app instances and average droplet size since the initial deployment can increase the upgrade impact on your system. |

To review example upgrade-related performance measurements of an existing production Cloud Foundry deployment, see the [Pivotal Web Services Performance During Upgrade](../opsguide/pws_upgrade_load.html) topic.

### <a id="bosh-clean-up"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up

Run `bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all` to clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other resources before upgrade. This cleanup helps prevent the product and stemcell upload process from exceeding the BOSH Director's available persistent disk space.


## <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

The following sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment is healthy before you perform the upgrade.

### <a id="collect-foundation-health-status"></a> Collect Foundation Health Status

For collecting foundation health status, Pivotal recommends PCF Healthwatch, which monitors and alerts on the current health, performance, and capacity of PCF. For more information, see the [PCF Healthwatch documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html).

If you are not using PCF Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to collect foundation health status:

* If your PCF deployment has external metrics monitoring set up, verify that VM CPU, RAM, and disk use levels are within reasonable levels.
* Run BOSH CLI commands to check system status:
	* `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME instances --ps`. <p>`bosh instances` with the flags `--ps`, `--vitals`, or `--failing` highlights individual job failure.</p>
	* `bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals`. This reveals VMs with high CPU, high memory, high disk utilization, and with `state` != `running`.
	* `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME cck --report`
* Check Ops Manager GUI each PAS/Tiles the status page for CPU/RAM/DISK utilization
* Validate Ops Manager persistent disk usage is below 50%. If not, follow the procedure in [Confirm Adequate Disk Space](#confirm-om-disk).

(Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade. For more information, see [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view).

### <a id="push-test-app"></a> Push and Scale a Test App

Check that a test app can be pushed and scaled horizontally, manually or through automated testing. This check ensures that the platform supports apps as expected before the upgrade.

### <a id="validate-mysql-cluster-health"></a> Validate MySQL Cluster Health

If you are running PAS MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster.

See the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in the [Running mysql-diag](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pas/mysql-diag.html) topic.

### <a id="check-health"></a> Review Pending and Recent Changes

1. Confirm there are no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be **green**. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** if necessary.

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    <pre>
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    </pre>


## <a id="export"></a> Export Your Installation

To export your installation, do the following:

1. In your Ops Manager v2.4 **Installation Dashboard**, click the account dropdown and select **Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrade_to_1.9.png") %>

1. On the **Settings** screen, select **Export Installation Settings** from the left menu, then click **Export Installation Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/export_install_settings.png") %>

This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.

When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings, but does not include releases between upgrades if Ops Manager has already uploaded them to BOSH. When backing up PCF, you must take this into account by backing up the BOSH blobstore that contains the uploaded releases. BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the BOSH blobstore. For more information, see [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](../customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).

* The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
* Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export process and might appear to hang.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<%= image_tag("./images/compress.png") %>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you fail to perform the remedial steps for this issue, this upgrade process may corrupt your existing usage data.</p>
